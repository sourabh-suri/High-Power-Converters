# High-Power-Converters  
Considering two machines, single transmission line power system with the sending and
receiving end rms voltages of 220 kV and their phase angle difference δ is 30.  
The transmission line impedance is 100 Ω (primarily inductive) Designing and simulating an SVC and a STATCOM
which should be able to control the midpoint voltage in the range from 0.7 p u to 1.3 p u.  
The simulation program is able to follow the change in mid point reference and the controller should accordingly
act during the simulation run.
